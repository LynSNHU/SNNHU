This is for my CS 250 class
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How I interpret user needs is by asking the appropriate questions and documenting the responses in a product backlog. User stories help because I can organize the responses into separate categories based on what the client wants. I can write the features that the client wants and add a statement that summarizes what the client wants. 
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
How I approach developing programs is by looking at the product backlog that has been provided and making a strategic plan. What agile process I hope to incorporate in my future development work is communication mostly. I also would like to incorporate scrum events as well and make sure I am keeping track and updating others on my tasks if I am in a team.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is someone who actively listens. They provide feedback and help others where they need it. They ask questions when they need help with something, so it doesn’t slow down the process. A good team member also respects other time and feelings as well.
